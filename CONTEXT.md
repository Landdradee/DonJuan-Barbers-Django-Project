**Project Context**

The website's header is fully functional on desktop screens but does not work correctly on mobile devices. The goal is to ensure the header operates seamlessly on mobile by integrating the hamburger menu found in `hamburguer.html`, `hamburguer.css`, and `hamburguer.js` while preserving its current modern design.

### **Requirements:**
- Fix mobile compatibility issues without altering the existing desktop functionality.
- Ensure the hamburger menu integrates while maintaining the current design.
- Do not remove or modify the design elements that contribute to the modern look of the menu.

### **Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Django
