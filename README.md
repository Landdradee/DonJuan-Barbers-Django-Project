## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (recommended)
- **Pip** (Python package installer)
- **Virtualenv** (optional but recommended for creating isolated environments)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DonJuan-Barbers.git
cd DonJuan-Barbers
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
To avoid conflicts with other Python projects, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv DonJuanVENV
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  DonJuanVENV\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source DonJuanVENV/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up the Database
This project uses **SQLite** by default. To set up the database, run the following commands:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser (Admin)
To access the financial management panel, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your admin credentials.

### 6. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)
If the project uses environment variables (e.g., for secret keys or API keys), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables. Refer to `.env.example` (if provided) for guidance.
